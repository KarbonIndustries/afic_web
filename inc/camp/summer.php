<p class="pgraph">Get your city kid involved with nature this summer. The Art
Farm summer camp engages your child in care and compassion of all living
creatures. Campers will meet live animals from our indoor petting zoo each
day. Kids will get their hands dirty in our patio garden, experience sunshine
on walks to the playground, play sports in our state-of-the-art gym facilities
and new this year, campers will participate in building and engineering. The
Art Farm believes children should experience nature through hands-on
experiences, farm to table cooking lessons and artistic endeavors! Our expert
educators are ready to teach, lead and nurture your children all summer
long!</p>

<p class='pgraph'>Activities, special events and projects will center around
our <a class='bold blue2' href='#weekly_themes'>weekly themes</a> which will include The “Magic” of
Camp, Adventure Land, Cruise Around the World and many beloved Art Farm themes
such as Superhero Week, and Exotic Animal Week!</p>

  <p class="pgraph">Offering half-day camp in a warm, nurturing environment we
  make sure that separation is gentle and easy for children and caregivers.
  Campers will have animal science lessons and up-close encounters with our
  live animals daily. They will create art masterpieces, garden, cook in the
  kitchen, and will enjoy playing musical instruments in music with guitar and
  singing. Every day, our campers will get fresh air outside on the terrace,
  play parachute games, participate in water play, and more. They will also
  have indoor soccer, yoga, and active games. Twice a week campers will enjoy
  special events so even if your child does a partial week they will get to
  participate in all activities. Please pack a nut-free lunch for your child or
  buy one through our lunch program. Our half-day campers will remain on the
  grounds of the Trevor Day facility throughout the camp day.</p>

  <p class='pgraph'>Half-day campers will receive complimentary passes to our
  afternoon drop-in at The Art Farm for petting zoo, art and play room. Passes
  will be granted for the equal amount of days they are attending camp and they
  must be used within the enrolled summer.</p>
