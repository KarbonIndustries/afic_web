    We offer a half-day camp with a warm, nurturing program so that separation
    is easy. Children will have animal science lessons and up-close encounters
    with our live animals daily. They will create art masterpieces, garden,
    cook in the kitchen, and will enjoy playing musical instruments in music
    with guitar and singing. Every day, our campers will get fresh air outside
    on the terrace, play parachute games, water play, and more. They will also
    have indoor soccer, yoga, and physical games. Every week, the children will
    participate in a weekly theme event which takes place on Tuesdays and
    Wednesdays, so all campers can enjoy the fun. Please pack a nut-free lunch
    for your child or buy one through our lunch program. Our half-day campers
    will remain on the grounds of the Trevor Day facility during camp. Half-day
    campers will receive complimentary passes to our afternoon drop-in at The
