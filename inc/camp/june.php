  <p class="pgraph">Our June camp is the perfect program for children ages 3-5
  to kick off their summer. Run by our preschool team, the children will be
  engaged in activities that will revolve around our weekly themes, Beach Week
  and Artists Week. Campers will participate in music, art, cooking, science,
  nature, games, and live animal science lessons where the children will meet
  and pet new animals every day. The children will engage in many
  age-appropriate activities with lots of laughter and fun as we all celebrate
  the beginning of summer. Campers will go outside to the courtyard every day,
  weather-depending, to play ball, parachute, sidewalk chalk, bubbles, and
  games.</p>

  <p class="pgraph">The Art Farm will be partnering with The Iken Science
  Academy and the camp will be hosted at their school at 351 East
  74<sup>th</sup> Street between 1<sup>st</sup> Avenue &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup>
  Avenue.</p>
