    We offer a half day camp with a warm nurturing program. Children spend time
    learning about holding and caring for our animals. They create art
    masterpieces, bake goodies, and sing their favorite songs to live guitar.
    Lots of play fun and games to celebrate winter break. We will provide a
    snack for your child and if your child is not fully potty trained, please
    send him or her in pull-ups. We close the group at 15 children with 3
    qualified teachers. Children must be 3 years old to join the group.

    Our Full day campers participate in music, art, cooking, science, nature,
    games, and live science animal lessons where the children will meet and pet
    new animals every day. The children will engage in many age-appropriate
    activities with lots of laughter and fun as we all celebrate winter break.
    Please send your child to camp with a lunch that is nut-free since we are
    a nut-free facility. We will provide the children with a snack before the
    end of the day. We close each group at 15 children with 3 qualified
    teachers.
