    Spring is in the air and we want you to join us for some fun! From <strong>
    ladybugs, baby chicks, and caterpillars to butterflies and more!</strong>
    All children will have an up-close and personal experience with our animals
    and be a part of live animal <strong>science</strong> classes. They will
    <strong>cook</strong> with our chef, create <strong>art</strong>
    masterpieces, and sing along with a guitarist during <strong>music</strong>.
    Since Spring will be upon us, all children will go outside, every day, to
    the courtyard for outdoor games (weather-permitting). We will provide a
    snack for half-day campers before pick-up. Full-day campers, please bring
    a nut-free lunch. We will provide snack before pick-up from camp.
  </p>

  <p class='pgraph bold'>
    We will be partnering with The Iken Science Academy and our Spring Break
    Camp will be hosted at 351 E. 74th St. between 1<sup>st</sup> and
    2<sup>nd</sup> Ave.
