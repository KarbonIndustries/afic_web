    <p class="pgraph">We offer a half-day camp with a warm, nurturing program.
    Children spend time learning about holding and caring for our animals. They
    create art masterpieces, bake goodies, and sing their favorite songs to
    live guitar. Lots of play, fun, and games to celebrate spring break. We
    will provide a snack for your child and please provide a nut-free lunch.
    Your child will eat lunch before pick up. If your child is not fully
    potty-trained, please send him or her in pull-ups. Children must be 3 years
    old to join the group. All children must have a valid medical form to join
    the camp.</p>
