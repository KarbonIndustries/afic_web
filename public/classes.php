	<p class="pgraph">Join us on an animal adventure as we jump with the frogs and hop with the bunnies and learn about a new animal every week. We start out groovin' to the guitar, bouncing with the balls and dancing with our friends as we sing along with all types of instruments. As we wait with anticipation to meet the star of the show, "The Animal of The Week", we play and learn with toys that are similar to our animal visitor and just before he comes we settle down for a story. Once our special animal appears we get to touch, enjoy, and hear all about him. Every other week we pull out the paint, glue, feathers, sand and more as we create an animal masterpiece of our own. This one-of-a-kind class isn't over until you meet all of our friends in our indoor petting zoo.</p>
