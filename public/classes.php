	<p class='pgraph'>Join us on an animal adventure as we jump with the frogs and hop with the bunnies and learn about a new animal every week. We start out groovin' to the guitar, bouncing with the balls and dancing with our friends as we sing along with all types of instruments. As we wait with anticipation to meet the star of the show, "The Animal of The Week", we play and learn with toys that are similar to our animal visitor and just before he comes we settle down for a story. Once our special animal appears we get to touch, enjoy, and hear all about him. Every other week we pull out the paint, glue, feathers, sand and more as we create an animal masterpiece of our own. This one-of-a-kind class isn't over until you meet all of our friends in our indoor petting zoo.</p>

  <p class='pgraph'>Is your child ready for a longer class? Our Farm Friends, hour
  and a half class is the perfect program to engage your child in more play. We will
  introduce school concepts such as transitioning to other classrooms and activities,
  all with you, or your caregiver's support. This program will start in our main
  classroom giving your child many options such as play dough, puzzles, creative
  play with our kid's kitchen, trains, sensory activities and more. We will then
  gather for a small circle time to sing songs and say hello to our friends. Then
  it will be time for a healthy organic snack and a story. Before we venture to
  the petting zoo to see the animals, we will create an art project. Our program
  will end with meeting a new animal every week and free time in our petting zoo.</p>

  <p class='pgraph'>Join us for exploration and play through art. We will begin
  with open art time where the children will be invited to explore painting with
  different mediums and objects on a large piece of paper with their class. We
  will explore painting with bubble wrap, dragging small cars through paint and
  more. Then we will move onto a story which will help get our creativity flowing
  for our next project. Every week we will create a masterpiece using many different
  materials. Whether we paint on canvas, or create with recycled materials,
  everyone is sure to have fun creating art that will revolve around story book
  characters, the alphabet and the world around us. Children must attend with
  a caregiver and the older the child is, the more independent they can be. Before
  this hour class is through, it's time to visit all the animals in our petting
  zoo.</p>
