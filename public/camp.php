	<p class="pgraph">Our full day campers participate in music, art, cooking, animal care, science, nature and outdoor play. They also play sports every day. As the campers grow older we like to encourage independence through picking out what activities they want to participate in. Therefore, we give our Geckos group a chance to create their own schedule. The Geckos participate in electives twice a week where they get to customize their day. They can choose from jewelry making, digital photography, computer, wood working, dance, drama, animal science, sports and karaoke. Twice a week they play soccer at Carl Schurz Park instructed by Super Soccer Stars. They also swim twice a week at the 92nd Street Y, where they receive swim lessons instructed by the Red Cross trained lifeguards. Your child can be a beginner in the pool or a pro. The swim teachers will assess the children and teach lessons appropriately.  On Wednesdays the children have field day in Carl Schurz Park where they play relay races and outdoor games. Every week we focus on a different theme. The children enjoy special theme presentations and they will also get a chance to venture out on field trips throughout the summer.
