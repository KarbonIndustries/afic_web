excited to offer camp in a new state-of-the-art facility at the Trevor Day School
East Campus<br />on 95th St between 1st and 2nd Ave.</p>

<div class='clearB high20'></div>

<p class="pgraph">We will now be offering more age groups with the same exceptional
programming we are known for. The Art Farm will be offering a full-day and half-day
camp experience for ages 3-9 years old. All children will get hands-on experience
learning about our live animals. Full-day groups will take walking trips to our
indoor petting zoo several times a week and our half-day campers will receive passes
to visit The Art Farm with their family. All campers will garden and enjoy outdoor
activities on the terrace every day.</p>

<p class='pgraph'>Every camper will enjoy cooking with us as we introduce our
farm-to-table lessons that coincide with our gardening. Full-day campers will swim
at the 92nd St. Y and all groups will participate in many physical activities
including indoor soccer and games. All of our art will revolve around our
<a class='blue2 bold' href='#weekly_themes'>weekly themes</a> which will include
special events.</p>

<p class='pgraph'>
  <span class='bold'>Our <a class='blue2' href='#weekly_themes'>weekly themes</a>
  include:</span> Mini Olympics, Safari Adventure, Under The Sea, Circus Mania,
  Blast Off Into Space.

  <p class="pgraph">We offer a half-day camp with a warm, nurturing program so that
  separation is easy. Children will have live animal science lessons and up-close
  encounters with our live animals daily. They will create art masterpieces, garden,
  cook in the kitchen, and will enjoy playing musical instruments in music with
  guitar and singing. Every day, our campers will get fresh air outside on the
  terrace, play parachute games, water play, and more. They will also have indoor
  soccer, yoga, and physical games to keep them busy. Every week, the children get
  to participate in a weekly theme event which takes place on Tuesday and Wednesday
  so all campers can participate in the fun. Please pack a lunch for your child
  or buy one through our lunch program. Our half-day campers will remain on the
  grounds of the Trevor Day facility during camp. Half-day campers will receive
  passes to see the animals in The Art Farm petting zoo to go with their family
  during the week. Passes will be granted for the equal amount of days they are
  attending camp and they must be used within their camp week.</p>

  will have 2 days of swimming at the 92nd St Y and the other 3 days will be a
  combination of sports including indoor soccer, yoga, dance, and physical games.

  day of swimming and the other days they will have other included sports. During
  swim, the children will receive swim lessons instructed by Red Cross-trained
