	<span class="marginT5 block marginB10 size14 gray2">Our animal education specialist, Gabby Sachs, has been teaching children about animals since 1992 in several zoo education departments. Most recently she taught in the Bronx Zoo's education department, where she educated thousands of school children about animals and the environment. Through her dynamic and interactive teaching style Gabby encourages children to use all of their senses when observing animals.  By using this multi-sensory approach, children gain a better understanding and appreciation of the natural world.</span>
