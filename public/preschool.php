  <span class='title2 blue2 marginB10'>One of a kind program&hellip;</span>

  <p class='pgraph'>
    Our philosophy is to provide opportunities for our children to grow
    socially, emotionally, and intellectually in a warm, loving, and nurturing
    environment. We believe children learn through hands-on activities and
    exploration through the arts and nature. Children will be exposed to a wide
    variety of programming which will engage them in a play-based learning
    environment with a strong sense of age-appropriate academics. Our little
    students learn to become self-reliant and develop a strong self-image as we
    encourage everyone's various learning styles and interests. The incredible
    connection between children and animals promotes the love of nature and the
    outside world, which is especially valuable in a city environment.
  </p>

  <p class='pgraph'>
    Throughout the day, the children are encouraged to socialize with their
    peers and work together in a classroom setting. Our program runs from
    September through June.

  <span class='subtitle1 bold' style='color:#CC0000'>Curriculum</span>
  <p class='pgraph'>
    Our 2s and 3s is based on a monthly theme curriculum with a focus on
    colors, shapes, numbers, and letters. Our 4s is based on The New York
    State Universal Pre-K Standards.

    Daily Live Animal Science Lessons
  </span>
  <p class='pgraph'>
    Every day in school, a live animal will visit your child's classroom. The
    teachers will teach the children how to hold and pet the animal as well as
    teach them about their natural environments, diets, characteristics, and
    more. Physical science is also a strong part of our curriculum. The
    children engage in many different experiments and discuss the results.
  </p>

  <span class='subtitle1 bold' style='color:#009966'>Art</span>
  <p class='pgraph'>
    Children are encouraged to express themselves through art and take pride
    and ownership in their work.
  </p>

  <span class='subtitle1 bold' style='color:#FF6600'>Music</span>
  <p class='pgraph'>
    We feel learning through arts is very important. Our children participate
    in music every week. Bilingual Birdies is a unique language and music
    program for young children. Half of the school week your child will get
    this amazing language program, which will begin to teach your child Spanish
    set to music children. Your child will also sing along with the guitar and
    play instruments with one of our own music teachers the other half of the
    week that we don't have Bilingual Birdies.
  </p>

  <span class='subtitle1 bold' style='color:#660099'>Cooking</span>
  <p class='pgraph'>
    Our little chefs cook a couple times a month right in their classroom using
    organic ingredients and their own cooking utensils. We promote healthy
    eating habits when cooking in our kitchen and during snack time, and we
    also teach them how to recycle.
  </p>

  <span class='subtitle1 bold' style='color:#FFCC00'>Movement</span>
  <p class='pgraph'>
    Children engage in seasonal outdoor play movement and physical activities
    in the gym. We know the children really need to get physical and run around
    the older they get. Our 3 and 4-year-old programs go to the gym once a week
    for relay races, ball play and indoor physical games. All programs do music
    and movement in their classroom every week as well.
