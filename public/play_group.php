<p class='pgraph'>All children joining the program must be 2 years old by the
beginning of the enrolled semester. Our warm, cozy atmosphere and our nurturing
staff will help your child to play independently and relax. And best of all, our
animals will get their attention. All of this combined will allow your child to
feel safe and get ready to play on their own with our teachers. Our Play Group
is designed to encourage independence, help develop social skills, and promote
interaction among the children in the group.  this class is closed at eight
2-year-olds and two teachers. Our program is based on creative play, and lets
children explore and enjoy our classroom with toys, puzzles, and blocks, as well
as enjoy the parachute and familiar songs in our music room. They will also get
a chance to create masterpieces during art, have a healthy snack and best of all,
cuddle with our animals.</p>
